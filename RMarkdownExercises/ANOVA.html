<h1>R Markdown Exercise: Multi-Sample Tests and Randomization Test</h1>
    
<p>Please use <a href="ANOVA_Randomization_template.Rmd" target="_blank">this template</a> (Right click and choose Save Link As...) for this RMarkdown exercise.</p>
    
<p>In this problem, you will analyze the Stat 100 survey 3 data in Fall 2015. The csv file can be downloaded <a target="_blank" href="Stat100_2015fall_survey03.csv">here</a>. The column variables are described on <a href="Stat100_2015fall_survey03.html" target="_blank">this webpage</a>. The purpose of this exercise is to find out if there is any association between happiness (a person's subjective well-being) and a person's temperament (introvert/extrovert/ambirvert).</p>
    
<ol class="question">

<li>(2 points) Create box plots of 'happiness' for the introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. Add the group means to the box plots.</li>

<li>(3 points) Perform an F-test to determine if there are any significant differences on the reported scale of happiness among introverts, extroverts and ambiverts. Report the p-value and state your conclusion.</li>

<li>(4 points) Perform pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction to adjust the p-values. Determine from the adjusted p-values which pairs of groups show significant differences at the 5% level.</li>

<li>(5 points) Perform a randomization test by scrambling the 'happiness' variable and calculate the values of R<sup>2</sup> of the scrambled data. Repeat the experiment at least 5000 times. Make a histogram of these R = &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">R<sup>2</sup></span> and indicate the position of the original R (from the unscrambled data).<br /> 
Note: The result of your randomization test must be <b>reproducible</b>. Therefore, you must set a seed number before calling any function involving random numbers. Use <code>set.seed(your UIN)</code> to set the seed. You can simply follow the procedure in <a href="../Week11/ANOVA.html" target="_black">this week's notes</a>. You are not required to optimize the code.</li>

<li>(3 points) Use the result of (d) to estimate the p-value. How does this estimated p-value compare to the one computed in part (b)?</li>
</ol>
    
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
    
<ul>
<li>Write down your name in the R markdown file.</li>    
<li>Generate an html file from the markdown file by knitr.</li>
<li>You should download the data file to your computer and then load it to R, instead of loading it directly from the website. This is for the purpose of reproducibility: the file at the remote website may be changed or disappear later and your R markdown file cannot be run. By saving it to your computer in the same location of the markdown file, you can be sure that your markdown result is reproducible.</li>
<li>Show all codes and output. If your code chunk contains more than a few lines, include a brief explanation of what you are doing unless you write your code in a self-explanatory style.</li>
<li>Label and state the answers to each question clearly. Don't just show the code and say that the information is in the output.</li>
</ul>

<br />
    
<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
<p><li><a href="ANOVA_Randomization.Rmd">RMarkdown file</a> (Download the file and save it in the same folder as the data file you downloaded above. Open it with R Studio and then click "Knit".)</li></p>
<p><li><a href="ANOVA_Randomization.html">Knitted html file</a></li></p>
