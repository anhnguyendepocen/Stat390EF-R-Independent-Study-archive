<h1>STAT 390EF FAQs</h1>
    
<p><b>Many of the following FAQs are compiled based on comments students made in the past semesters. Click the questions to see our responses.</b></p>


<hr />
<button class="accordion">How much time do I have to spend on this course?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br />
<p>As mentioned in the syllabus, anticipate spending 6&ndash;8 hours a week. The following is a plot showing the distribution of the average number of hours students spent in the course in the Spring 2017 semester. The data were gathered from an anonymous survey near the end of the semester. The mean is 6.5 hrs/week and the median is 6 hrs/week.</p>

<button class="accordion">Is it easy to get an A?</button>
<div class="panel">
<br />
<p>For many people, this course does require hard work to get an A. In Spring 2017, 36 out of 45 students got A and A+ (77%). Of course, these were students who finished the course. Those who were not happy about the grade they would get dropped the course.</p>
</div>
    
<br />
 
<button class="accordion">Why is this course so demanding at the beginning?</button>
<div class="panel">  
<br />
<p>It is true that weeks 4-7 are demanding, and it is partly intentional. We want people to know that this is not an easy course. It requires hard work and is time consuming. 
This is an <b>independent</b> study. 
<b>This course is not for everyone</b>. Some people cannot learn well by just studying the material on their own. We believe that there is no shortcut in learning a programming 
language. Making the workload somewhat heavier in those weeks is to 
encourage students who don't have the time or who aren't willing to spend the time required for this course to drop.</p>
<p>R is a programming language for statistical analysis and computing. We don't want to just tell 
you a bunch of commands. We hope you can gain experience in using R to do data analysis 
and solve statistical problems. So you need to know Statistics in order to benefit from 
learning R. If you were in Stat 200 L1 or L2, you probably had heard the instructor discouraging people from 
taking this course. For people who have no experience in computer programming, it's 
too much to learn Statistics and R at the same time. It's a cognitive overload.</p>
</div>    
    
<br />

<button class="accordion">Why is the workload so heavy? I put more time into this 2-credit-hour class than I did for my 3-credit-hour Stat 420 class.</button>
    
<div class="panel">
<br />
<p>As we mention above, we don't want to just tell you a bunch of commands. We hope you will be able to use R to perform data analysis. To be able to do that, you need to learn the basic programming skills and structure in R. As with all computer programming, you need to spend time practicing it over and over in order to be good at it. We believe that there is no shortcut in learning a programming language. It requires even harder work if you have no prior programming experience. We are trying to make the course 3 credit hours, but it may take a while. Until then, it's up to you to decide if it's worth taking this 2-credit-hour independent study.</p>

<button class="accordion">Some of the questions on Lon-capa are poorly worded... Can they be worded more clearly?</button>
    
<div class="panel"> 
<br />
<p>We think the questions are very clear, but since we made them we might not realize that they might not be clear from the student's point of view. If you think the questions are not clear, post suggestions on the Lon Capa message board to help us make improvements.</p>

    <br />
  

<button class="accordion">Why isn't there more explanation on the looping part 
and writing our own function? Those parts are the most <br /> challenging for me.</button>
<div class="panel">
<br />
<p>The student who made this comment also indicated that he/she didn't use Peng textbook and 
videos. So he/she skipped all the required reading assignments on the book. If you skipped the reading, you would end up paying 
for it later. Not only shouldn't you skip any reading assignment, but you have to read 
actively, actually doing all the calculations, not just reading about them.</p>
<p>The book spends 7 pages covering control structures, 
15 pages covering functions, 18 pages covering loop functions. You can also watch the 
videos linked in the book if you prefer. There are total 15 minutes of videos on the control 
structure, 28 minutes of videos on functions, and 34 minutes of videos on loop functions. 
</p>
<p>These resources are not necessarily the best for beginners, but at least make an effort 
to study them if you are struggling.</p>

<button class="accordion">It would be great if there was a group project so that we will have chance to connect with people...<br />
Spending part of the time in a class room setting would be very beneficial...<br />
    Can we have more TAs?...</button>
<div class="panel">
<br />
<p>Of course you're right, but we don't have the resources for this 
stuff. We are not getting paid to teach or develop materials for 390 and we are not even allowed to have a TA dedicated to 390. Requests for resources
could be directed to the Statistics Department (dgs@illinois.edu). </p>

<button class="accordion">Can you set up a message board? Previous classes I have taken
use Moodle. This way, even though this course is online, we could interact and
talk with fellow students and TAs/professors. The comments on Lon Capa<br /> don't
satisfy my desire for such a service.</button>
<div class="panel">  
<br />
<p>Yes, we can set up a chat room or a message board on either Lon Capa or Compass.</p>

<button class="accordion">Would it be possible to get a hint on a HW problem after a few tries?</button>
<div class="panel">  
<br />
<p>This course doesn't have exams, so the HW assignments have dual purposes: practice + evaluation. We can make the HW count less to your course grade by having exams. We asked students in the previous semester if they'd like to have exams. Only 3 out of 49 people preferred to have exams.</p>
    
<p>Note that you don't have to get every question correct in order to get an A. It's ok to make a few mistakes in the HW problems as long as you learn from the mistakes.</p>

<button class="accordion">Is it possible to have a page containing all the notes? It was so hard to find out where the previous codes were.</button>
<div class="panel">  
<br />
<p>In response to a similar request in a previous semester, we created a page following the weekly notes containing all the commands covered so far. This is apparently not adequate for some students.</p>
<p>It is possible for <em>us</em> to create an html page combining all of the notes, but it is unclear how much benefit it will be to <em>you</em>. The reason that <em>you</em> find it hard to find the place to look for a particular code is because <em>you</em> fail to retain the information <em>you</em>'ve learned. Therefore, it is more useful for <em>you</em> to compile a list of commands/codes in a way that is easy for <em>you</em> to search for. See this <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf" target="_blank">base R cheat sheet</a> made by <a href="http://mhairihmcneill.com/" target="_blank">Mhairi McNeill</a> for an example of a nicely-made compilation of base R commands.</p> 
    
<p>We suggest that <em>you</em> make a customized cheat sheet instead of using one made by another person, because <a href="https://www.missiontolearn.com/note-taking/" target="_blank">active note-taking</a> is effective in enhancing long-term retention of information.</p>
</div>

    <br />
    
<button class="accordion">I took this course concurrently with Stat 200. I felt it would be better for the two courses to be more closely connected: having the same topics covered in the same weeks.</button>
<div class="panel">  
<br />
<p>Actually, we deliberately avoid covering the same topics in the same weeks for pedagogical reasons. Covering the same topic in each week will certainly make it easier and faster for students to learn, but what students don't realize is that it also makes them <em>forget</em> the material faster. Studies show that <em>spaced</em> or <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/" target="_blank"><em>interleaved</em> practices</a> are effective in the retention and consolidation of information.</p>
<p>The reason why you find it harder to learn when the material is covered in the interleaved way is because by the time you see the topic again, you have forgotten some of it and have to review it. Metaphorically speaking, seeing the topics multiple times in the interleaved manner is to tell your brain that: "Hey, I see these things again! They are not  things I need to know in a short period of time and be done with. These are things I will encounter again and again in the future, so I'd better pay attention and not forget them!"</p>
    
<p>In addition, when you see the topic the second time, it is presented in a different way and may sometimes mixed in a different context. You may gain a new perspective on the concepts.</p>

<button class="accordion">Why is programming so time consuming, especially for beginners? I sometimes get stuck on my code for hours just because I wrote one single line wrong. It's very difficult for me to find my own mistake so I have to test my code again and again to find out where I did wrong.</button>
<div class="panel">   
<br />
<p>First, you won't do extensive coding in this course. Most of the time you will only need to write a few lines of R code, which is nothing compared to writing 50-150 lines of codes from scratch in a typical course on computer programming.  (For those of you who love coding, you may be disappointed in this course. Consider taking STAT 385 instead.)</p>
    
<p>Second, you just describe the experience of everyone who first learns to code.  It's somewhat like doing algebric manipulations. One little careless mistake and you get a wrong answer. The difference here is that computers have zero tolerance on mistakes, and getting a working code is usually not the end of the exercise but an essential step in solving the problem you are asked. </p>
    
<p>Yes, coding can be time consuming, but you'll get better at it through constant practice and hard work. You might enjoy coding after a while. After years of hard work (if you choose to do so), you'll be able to correct a simple mistake at no time. Of course by then you'll probably be working with a complex code with thousands of lines, and you'll be faced with subtle bugs that may take hours, days, or weeks to fix.</p>
    
<p>A friend of mine once told me that he likes catching bugs and fixing them. To him it's more entertaining than playing video games! Even if you don't share his passion, having some experience on coding can still be valuable.</p>
